<div class="textblock"><p>Class for configuring "collision filters"; collision filters limit the scope of various proximity queries. </p>
<p>The sole source of CollisionFilterManager instances is <a class="el" href="classdrake_1_1geometry_1_1_scene_graph.html" title="SceneGraph serves as the nexus for all geometry (and geometry-based operations) in a Diagram.">SceneGraph</a>. See <a class="el" href="classdrake_1_1geometry_1_1_scene_graph.html#scene_graph_collision_filter_manager">SceneGraph's documentation</a> for details on acquiring an instance.</p>
<p>A <a class="el" href="classdrake_1_1geometry_1_1_scene_graph.html" title="SceneGraph serves as the nexus for all geometry (and geometry-based operations) in a Diagram.">SceneGraph</a> instance contains the set of geometry <span class="tt">G = D ⋃ A = {g₀, g₁, ..., gₙ}</span>, where D is the set of dynamic geometries and A is the set of anchored geometries (by definition <span class="tt">D ⋂ A = ∅</span>). <span class="tt">Gₚ ⊂ G</span> is the subset of geometries that have a proximity role (with an analogous interpretation of <span class="tt">Dₚ</span> and <span class="tt">Aₚ</span>). Many proximity queries operate on pairs of geometries (e.g., (gᵢ, gⱼ)). The set of proximity candidate pairs for such queries is initially defined as <span class="tt">C = (Gₚ × Gₚ) - (Aₚ × Aₚ) - Fₚ - Iₚ</span>, where:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="tt">Gₚ × Gₚ = {(gᵢ, gⱼ)}, ∀ gᵢ, gⱼ ∈ Gₚ</span> is the Cartesian product of the set of <a class="el" href="classdrake_1_1geometry_1_1_scene_graph.html" title="SceneGraph serves as the nexus for all geometry (and geometry-based operations) in a Diagram.">SceneGraph</a> proximity geometries.</li>
<li><span class="tt">Aₚ × Aₚ</span> represents all pairs consisting only of anchored geometries; an anchored geometry is never tested against another anchored geometry.</li>
<li><span class="tt">Fₚ = {(gᵢ, gⱼ)} ∀ i, j</span>, such that <span class="tt">gᵢ, gⱼ ∈ Dₚ</span> and <span class="tt">frame(gᵢ) == frame(gⱼ)</span>; the pairs where both geometries are rigidly affixed to the same frame.</li>
<li><span class="tt">Iₚ = {(g, g)}, ∀ g ∈ Gₚ</span> is the set of all pairs consisting of a geometry with itself; there is no meaningful proximity query on a geometry with itself.</li>
</ul>
<p>Only pairs contained in C will be included in pairwise proximity operations.</p>
<p>The manager provides an interface to modify the set C. Changes to C are articulated with <a class="el" href="classdrake_1_1geometry_1_1_collision_filter_declaration.html" title="Class for articulating changes to the configuration of SceneGraph&#39;s &quot;collision filters&quot;; collision fi...">CollisionFilterDeclaration</a>. Once a change has been <em>declared</em> it is applied via the manager's API to change the configuration of C.</p>
<p>There are limits to how C can be modified.</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="tt">∀ (gᵢ, gⱼ) ∈ C</span>, both gᵢ and gⱼ must be registered with <a class="el" href="classdrake_1_1geometry_1_1_scene_graph.html" title="SceneGraph serves as the nexus for all geometry (and geometry-based operations) in a Diagram.">SceneGraph</a>; you can't inject arbitrary ids. Attempting to do so will result in an error.</li>
<li>No pairs in <span class="tt">Aₚ × Aₚ</span>, <span class="tt">Fₚ</span>, or <span class="tt">Iₚ</span> can ever be added to C. Excluding those pairs is a <a class="el" href="classdrake_1_1geometry_1_1_scene_graph.html" title="SceneGraph serves as the nexus for all geometry (and geometry-based operations) in a Diagram.">SceneGraph</a> invariant. Attempts to do so will be ignored.</li>
</ul>
<p>The current configuration of C depends on the sequence of filter declarations that have been applied in the manager. Changing the order can change the end result.</p>
<p>A CollisionFilterManager is a view into geometry data (either that owned by a <a class="el" href="classdrake_1_1geometry_1_1_scene_graph.html" title="SceneGraph serves as the nexus for all geometry (and geometry-based operations) in a Diagram.">SceneGraph</a> instance or a <a class="el" href="classdrake_1_1geometry_1_1_scene_graph.html" title="SceneGraph serves as the nexus for all geometry (and geometry-based operations) in a Diagram.">SceneGraph</a> context). The manager instance can be copied or moved and the resulting instance is a view into the same data. For both the original and the copy (or just the target when moving the manager), the source data must stay alive for at least as long as the manager instance.</p>
<dl class="section warning"><dt>Warning</dt><dd>The effect of applying a declaration is based on the state of <a class="el" href="classdrake_1_1geometry_1_1_scene_graph.html" title="SceneGraph serves as the nexus for all geometry (and geometry-based operations) in a Diagram.">SceneGraph</a>'s geometry data at the time of application.

If geometries are subsequently added or assigned the proximity role, they will not be retroactively added to the user-declared filter.</li>
<li>If the geometry set in a declaration statement includes geometries which have <em>not</em> been assigned a proximity role, those geometries will be ignored. If a proximity role is subsequently assigned, those geometries will <em>still</em> not be part of any user-declared collision filters.</li>
<li>In general, adding collisions and assigning proximity roles should happen prior to collision filter configuration.</li>
</ul>
</dd></dl>
<h3>Transient vs Persistent changes</h3>
<p>Collision filtering is all about defining which geometry pairs are in the set C. The simplest way to modify the set C is through <em>persistent</em> modifications to a "base configuration" (via calls to <a class="el" href="#a67386b6917b1243e34c6f092d4956386" title="Applies the given declaration to the geometry state managed by this instance.">Apply()</a>). However, declarations can also be applied in a <em>transient</em> manner. Transient declarations form a history. The current definition of the set C is the result of applying the history of collision filter declarations to the persistent base configuration in order. That history can be modified:</p>
<ul>
<li>New transient declarations can be appended.</li>
<li>Arbitrary transient declarations can be removed from the sequence.</li>
<li>The current configuration (based on a history with an arbitrary number of transient declarations) can be "flattened" into the persistent base (with no history).</li>
</ul>
<p>The table below illustrates a sequence of operations and their effect on C. We define C's initial configuration as <span class="tt">C = {P₁, P₂, ..., Pₙ}</span> (for <span class="tt">n</span> geometry pairs). Each action is described as either persistent or transient.</p>

<p><b>Table 1</b>: An example sequence of operations on collision filters.</p>
<p>Notes:</p><ul>
<li>lines 2 - 4 represent a series of <em>persistent</em> operations, filtering pairs of geometry (aka removing them from C by calling <a class="el" href="#a67386b6917b1243e34c6f092d4956386" title="Applies the given declaration to the geometry state managed by this instance.">Apply()</a>).</li>
<li>line 5: the first transient filter declaration which is assigned the id value #1 (via a call to <a class="el" href="#a0685b9bd25f37bd2cf50694b5c909e69" title="Applies the declaration as the newest transient modification to the collision filter configuration.">ApplyTransient()</a>).</li>
<li>line 6: Adds a new transient filter declaration to the sequence (assigned id #2). Note, that it redundantly declares that P₄ is a member of C just as declaration #1 did. This redundancy is fine. In fact, it may be very important (see below).</li>
<li>line 7: We remove declaration #1. Although #1 added both P₄ and P₅ to C, the result of removing this declaration from the sequence is that P₅ is no longer a member of C but P₄ <em>is</em>. This is because #2's declaration that P₄ is* in C preserves its membership.</li>
<li>line 8: the current configuration is "flattened" into the persistent base. All history is thrown out and any filter identifiers are rendered invalid.</li>
</ul>
<p>This example workflow above illustrates some key ideas in using transient declarations.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>The persistent configuration can only be modified when there is no transient history.</b> Applying a filter declaration should have the effect of realizing that declaration. If a pair is <em>declared</em> to be in C, the result of the declaration is that the pair is in C (assuming that the pair can* be in C). If we allowed modifying the persistent configuration with an active transient history, there might be no discernible change in the resultant configuration state because a subsequent transient declaration may supplant it. This would lead to inscrutable bugs. Therefore, it's simply not allowed.</li>
<li><b>When defining a transient declaration, the declaration should include all critical pairs <em>explicitly</em>.</b> This includes those pairs that should and should not be in C. Any pair <em>not</em> explicitly accounted for should be one whose filter status is immaterial. It <em>might</em> seems desirable (from an optimization perspective) to examine the <em>current</em> configuration of C and apply the minimum change to put it into a desired state (i.e., if a pair I need filtered is already filtered, I would omit it from the declaration). This approach is fraught with peril. If the current configuration is the result of previous transient declarations, the removal of any of those declarations could invalidate the attempted difference calculation and my declaration would no longer be sufficient to guarantee the set C required.</li>
<li><b>Anyone at any time can add to the history.</b> Some code can modify C to suit its needs. However, it can also make subsequent calls into code that also modifies C with no guarantees that the called code will undo those changes. Code that modifies collision filters configuration should document that it does so. It should also have a clear protocol for cleaning up its own changes. Finally, code that applies declarations should not take for granted that its transient declarations are necessarily the last declarations in the history.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Making transient filter declarations</h4>
<p>There is a custom API for applying a filter declaration as a <em>transient</em> declaration. It returns the id for the transient API (used to remove the declaration from the history sequence).</p>
<p>Attempting to change the persistent configuration when there are active transient declarations in the history will throw an exception. </p>
