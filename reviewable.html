      content="Drake (&quot;dragon&quot; in Middle English) is a C++ toolbox started by the Robot
Locomotion Group at the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence
Lab (CSAIL). The development team has now grown significantly, with core
development led by the Toyota Research Institute. It is a collection of
tools for analyzing the dynamics of our robots and building control
systems for them, with a heavy emphasis on optimization-based design/
analysis.

        <h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>

<p>Drake code reviews use <a href="https://reviewable.io">https://reviewable.io</a>. This page documents some
best practices for communicating effectively in Reviewable.</p>

<h1 id="github-integration">GitHub Integration</h1>

<p>Avoid using the GitHub UI to comment on code during a review. Reviewable will
import comments from GitHub, but cannot reliably match them to lines of diff.</p>

<p>When you enter comments in Reviewable, they are saved as drafts. Use the
“publish” button to send them out in a batch. Reviewable will post the
comments to the GitHub PR in a single, well-formatted block, generating email
to everyone else following the PR.</p>

<p>Every time you push to your GitHub branch under review, Reviewable will
snapshot a new diff. Because it maintains an independent diff series, you can
rebase freely without corrupting the review history.</p>

<h1 id="life-of-a-reviewable-comment">Life of a Reviewable Comment</h1>

<p>All threads in Reviewable must be resolved before you can merge your PR.</p>

<p>The semantics of discussion resolution is more nuanced than GitHub’s default
code review tool. We recommend to read <a href="https://github.com/Reviewable/Reviewable/issues/510#issue-272337333">this explanation</a> to
understand the details.</p>

<p>Before commenting on a line of code, reviewers should check to see if there
is already a resolved discussion addressing the same topic. Resolved
discussions are indicated by a small white check-mark in a grey circle to
the left of the line of code.</p>

<p>Reviewers should click the eye-shaped buttons to indicate that they have
reviewed a file.  Reviewable will remember the revisions at which the file
was reviewed, and mark them with an eye icon in the file history.</p>

<h1 id="curated-commits">Curated Commits</h1>

<p>Each commit on Drake master should pass all unit tests and lint checks, should
be logically cohesive (should not require other commits to make sense), and
should have a meaningful commit message.</p>

<p>Therefore, our reviewable settings by default prevent a PR with more than one
commit from being merged.</p>

<p>Often a PR may end up with more than one commit, including “work-in-progress”
checkpoints or “fix review comments” pushes.  In that case, when the PR is
ready to merge, the author of a PR has three choices for how to proceed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Wait for the assigned Platform Reviewer to “Squash and merge” the PR.
If time is of the essence, post a reminder to the PR.</li>
  <li>Locally (rebase and) squash the PR down to a single commit, and force-push
that commit into the PR.</li>
  <li>Apply the label <code class="highlighter-rouge">status: squashing now</code> and then immediately use the “squash
and merge” button to merge the PR, being careful to tweak the commit message
in the web page’s edit box to be a sensible description of the change.</li>
</ul>

<p>On the other hand, some PR authors carefully curate their commits so that each
individual commit on a PR meets the acceptance criteria on its own.  In that
case, the author should apply the label <code class="highlighter-rouge">status: commits are properly
curated</code>, which removes the single-commit requirement.  PRs with this label
should be merged to master using the “Create a merge commit” option, not
“Squash and merge” option.</p>

<h1 id="release-notes">Release Notes</h1>

<p>By default, your commit message’s subject line and full text will be collated
into the release notes as part of the next numbered release.  The collation
involves human review (it is not completely mechanical) so while we are able to
improve the text later as part of document assembly, please be kind to the
human editor and do your best to provide a correct and helpful commit message
up front.</p>

<p>The pull request will be not be allowed to merge until it has at least one
release notes label added:</p>

<p><strong>release notes: none</strong></p>

<p>Commits that do not meaningfully affect the release will be manually culled from
the release notes during editing.  To aid the human editor in making that
determination, you may add the tag <code class="highlighter-rouge">release notes: none</code> to the PR and the
commit will be omitted.  For example, you should apply that tag to any PRs that
only fix code style problems, or only affect tests or documentation.</p>

<p><strong>release notes: breaking change</strong></p>

<p>Commits that contain breaking changes receive special attention in the release
notes.  To aid the human editor in making that determination, you must add the
tag <code class="highlighter-rouge">release notes: breaking change</code> to any PR that makes a breaking change
to a <a href="/stable.html">Stable API</a> without a deprecation period.</p>

<p><strong>release notes: newly deprecated</strong><br />
 or<br />
<strong>release notes: removal of deprecated</strong></p>

<p>Commits that change deprecations receive special attention in the release notes.
To aid the human editor in making that determination, you must add the tag
<code class="highlighter-rouge">release notes: newly deprecated</code> to any PR that adds new deprecations, or
<code class="highlighter-rouge">release notes: removal of deprecated</code> to any PR that removes deprecated
code whose date has passed.  Removing deprecated code is not considered to be a
breaking change, so do not add <code class="highlighter-rouge">release notes: breaking change</code>.</p>

<p><strong>release notes: feature</strong><br />
 or<br />
<strong>release notes: fix</strong></p>

<p>Commits that implement a feature or a fix must be labeled with the
corresponding tag, either <code class="highlighter-rouge">release notes: feature</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">release notes: fix</code>
but never both at once; choose whichever one is the best match.</p>

<p><strong>When combining release notes labels:</strong></p>

<ul>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">none</code> must not be combined with any other label.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">breaking change</code> must be combined with either <code class="highlighter-rouge">feature</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">fix</code>.
If there were changes to deprecations, those labels should also be added.</li>
  <li><code class="highlighter-rouge">newly deprecated</code> will usually be combined with <code class="highlighter-rouge">feature</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">fix</code>,
because usually the deprecation is concurrent with the addition of its
replacement or due to some other new change. Only if the deprecation is the
<em>sole</em> content of the commit will <code class="highlighter-rouge">newly deprecated</code> be the only label.</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="joint-feature-and-platform-review">Joint Feature and Platform review</h1>

<p>For a review to be considered complete, both Feature Review and Platform Review
must be completed (see <a href="/developers.html#review-process">Review Process</a>).</p>

<p>Therefore, our reviewable settings require at least two assigned reviewers.  In
cases where the platform reviewer decides to double-count as feature review,
the reviewer should apply the label <code class="highlighter-rouge">status: single reviewer ok</code> to note this
condition, which removes the two-assignee requirement.</p>
